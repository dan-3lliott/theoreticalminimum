## Decoherence
The loss of quantum information of a qubit to its environment. This is characterized in a quantum computer by the decoherence time. The longer a qubit's decoherence time, the longer it is able to preserve its quantum information and therefore have quantum operations performed on it. 
## Qubit
The basic unit of information in a quantum computer, represented physically by a two state quantum system. A qubit differs from a classical bit in that it can exist in a superposition of its two quantum states. This is described mathematically by: $\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}$ where $|\alpha|^2, |\beta|^2$ represent the probabilities of measuring the qubit's state to be in the $\ket{0}$ or $\ket{1}$ respectively. 
## Entanglement
A non local interaction between multiple quantum systems such that their collective description cannot be broken down into the description of each individual quantum system. This is one of the fundamental tenants that make quantum computers powerful because when their qubits are entangled, the state space that they occupy scales by $2^n$ but one only needs to manipulate $n$ qubits, thus allowing for an exponential increase in information processing.
