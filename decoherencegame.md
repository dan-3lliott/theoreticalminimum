# Decoherence Game

This is a game designed to allow users to understand how qubits lose their quantum information in the process of decoherence, and how they can prevent that from happening using pulses. These are the same techniques used in quantum computers to extend the decoherence time of a qubit, preserving it's quantum information in the process.

I am currently programming the game however it is taking longer than expected. I will put any interesting relevant animations I have in here until I can get an operational game - DLG
