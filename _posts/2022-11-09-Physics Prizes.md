Quantum computing and quantum information
science have seen ever increasing attention from the
public, the economy, and the scientific community as a
whole. This sentiment rang true with the recent string of
high profile physics prizes awarded this year. These
awards were given to scientists who laid the bedrock
knowledge on which the function of quantum
technologies today rests. One notable prize for which
this occurred was the Breakthrough Prize in Physics. The
2023 Breakthrough Prize in Physics was awarded to
Peter Shor, David Deutsch, Gilles Brassard, and Charles
Bennett “for foundational work in the field of quantum
information”. It is safe to say that quantum computers
would not exist today if it weren’t for the work that
these scientists did. So it is worthwhile to go over their
results. Peter Shor is probably most well known for his
eponymous Shor’s algorithm. This algorithm was one of
the first major breakthroughs in the field of quantum
information to establish a real world application of a
quantum computer, that is being able to factor large
numbers and with an exponential speedup, thus posing
a security threat to all public key cryptographic
schemes. Aside from his famous algorithm, Peter Shor
also did seminal work on quantum error correction,
allowing quantum computers to correct errors and be
fault tolerant. Before this, it was thought that a large
quantum computer may be impossible to build because
it would have too many errors to be useful. David
Deutsch has also done pioneering work with quantum
algorithms. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm that he and
Richard Jozsa developed, was one of the first quantum
algorithms that was demonstrated to have an
exponential speed up over classical ones. He also
formulated the concept of a Quantum Turing machine along with helping
develop quantum key distribution.

  Quantum key distribution is one of the most influential
breakthroughs in the field of quantum information
science, and stands to change the way we encrypt our
data. Charlie Bennett and Gilles Brassard discovered the
first cryptographic schemes for doing this in 1984, BB84.
They later expanded on this work by developing other
quantum cryptography schemes. Gilles and Bennett also
developed the quantum teleportation algorithm,
whereby the quantum information of one qubit can be
transported to another one using entangled states.

John Clauser With His Original Entanglement Experiment

Speaking of entanglement, the 2022 Nobel Prize was
awarded precisely for experiments relating to it.
Specifically, the prize was given “for experiments with
entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell
inequalities and pioneering quantum information
science” and was given to John Clauser, Alain Aspect,
and Anton Zeilinger. Bell's Inequality was a set of
theoretical statements made by John Bell designed to
show whether or not quantum mechanics could be
explained by a theory of local hidden variables. These
hidden variables would refute the idea that quantum
mechanics is a fundamentally probabilistic theory and
challenge the weirdness of entanglement. John Clauser
first performed an experiment to test this idea in 1972.
Using entangled photons, he showed a violation of Bell's
inequality, thus showing that quantum mechanics is not
governed by hidden variables. Further experiments
were then performed by Alain Aspect in 1982 to close
loopholes potentially allowed by the original
experimental set ups that could allow for hidden variable explanations of quantum mechanics.
These set of experiments showed with increasing rigor 
that quantum mechanics cannot be
explained by local hidden variables and that behaviors
such as entanglement are inherently non local. These
experiments were then improved and expanded upon
by Anton Zeilinger.

Zeilinger performed many first within the field of
experimental quantum information science such as being
the first to perform experimental quantum teleportation
of a qubit, the first to perform entanglement swapping,
the first to perform entanglement with more than two
particles, the first to implement quantum cryptography
experimentally, etc. All of these pioneering experiments
established the knowledge of entanglement that is now
finding use in quantum computers, quantum
cryptography and quantum networking. It's safe to say
that the effects of the work for which this Nobel prize was
awarded are much more tangible and relevant than
many of those in recent years. The bottom line is that
quantum mechanics has been given new life. Not just by
physicists (although they kickstarted it) but increasingly
by businesses, governments, and everyday people. These
prizes are an indication of this and are only a small step
in this quantum revolution that is defining the 21st
century
