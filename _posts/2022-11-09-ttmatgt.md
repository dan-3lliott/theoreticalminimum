Georgia Tech students are some of the most technically competent problem solvers in the nation. As such, it is important that they be well-informed about important technological developments which bear relevance to their fields of study. Since quantum computing is poised to fundamentally change the way in which we perform computations, its potential impact is far-reaching and almost universally applicable within the sphere of modern technology. From the development of novel treatments within the pharmeceutical industry to the optimization of hypersonic flight vehicles within the aerospace industry, nearly all processes that rely on computation in any degree stand to be revolutionized. 

This begs the question, are students here at Georgia Tech being exposed to the core concepts, fundmental principles, and key developments within this rapidly developing domain of innovation? To find out the answer, members of TTM set out on campus to gauge the depth of knowledge pertaining to quantum computing possessed by a typical student at this institution. Though many of the individuals with whom we came in contact had no familiarity whatsoever, others were surprisingly knowledgeable about the current state of the quantum computing industry, the basic operating principles upon which quantum computers function, and so on. If you'd like to see firsthand the overall attitudes demonstrated by Georgia Tech students towards the topic around which this entire site is centered, then take three minutes of your time and watch the above video. You won't be disappointed.
