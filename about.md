**Why create TTM?**

The Theoretical Minimum (TTM), seeks to remedy the widespread ignorance regarding quantum computing. Each update will contain a variety of articles, such as recent news, foundational knowledge, history and past developments, applications, and limitations as well as an interactive section designed to reinforce learning or show examples of real-world quantum computing. 

TTM specializes in simplicity. Though quantum computing is a technical topic, it should not be kept shrouded in an aura of complexity. Quantum savvy people everywhere must simplify the complexities of quantum computing, for only then can it be universally understood and accepted. TTM aims to do just that by teaching the basics of quantum computing while keeping up-to-date with the rapidly evolving field. Some readers may go on to further educate themselves; some may not. In the end, however, quantum computing will be one step closer to being demystified.
